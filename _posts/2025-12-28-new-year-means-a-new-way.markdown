As you may know, Mann-E has been shut dowin in December 26th 2025 as a consumer facing platform and the main domain, redirects here which is hosted on [Github Pages](https://github.com) and you are no longer able to use our image, 3D and video generation engines. 

This was a really hard and heartbreaking decision to make, but it was necessary. Anyway, in this article, we'll just review why Mann-E didn't do well and then just work on how we'll be starting over in 2026 (or being more specific _how may we start over in 2026_.)

## Shut down was necessary 

As I previously have written in different forums, reddit, Linkedin and X (formerly known as twitter) the space of _Image/Video Generation Using AI_ has been saturated. Pretty much every major company has its own image or media model in general and it's obvious that a small team with close to no resource, specially in Iranian startup ecosystem - which looks like a place of cartels gathering - can't compete with those. 

Adding information, we tried and managed to get grants and helps from the international community (honestly, more than our local scene) and one of the best examples I can put out is when we released our model _Mann-E Dreams v0.0.4_ on [r/StableDiffusion](https://reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion) people just tested it a lot to the point it became a "trending" model on [Hugging Face](https://hf.co) and when we tried to reach out to [Runware](https://runware.ai) and [RunPod](https://runpod.io) both companies were generous enough to give us free resources to do our trial and errors. 

But our local ecosystem, nothing at best. Most of them just had sessions with us and promised that they will rely on our service as their image/media generation backend, but the moment we left their offices, they just announced they made their own "models" (nothing more than Dall-E 3 API honestly) and it was a heavy load on our backs as well. 

Finally, we have decided to shut it down and think about starting over.

## Starting over in 2026

Now, since we kept the domain, most of the source codes and procedures and also connections to the _good companies_ we are developing our 2026 vision, which includes "acting globally" from the day zero. Also, finding a more "niche" community for our product who are ready to pay (crypto or fiat, doesn't really matter what the form is) for the concept we're trying to sell. 

Economy has changed, the world has changed, so businesses have to change as well. I personally will keep this blog updated and write about Mann-E and how it'll be resurface in 2026 regularly at least for the very first few months of the new year. 

Finally, I wish all of the readers of the blog a peaceful, beautiful and wealthful year.
