## What is Mann-E? 

_Mann-E_ (Persian: مانی) was a generative artificial intelligence platform (or Generative AI for short) with specialization on making images, videos and 3D objects with the help of [Open Source](https://hf.co/mann-e) and also _state of the art_ AI models. 

Mann-E has been founded in 2023 by [Muhammadreza Haghiri](https://haghiri75.com/en) (Persian: [محمدرضا حقیری](https://haghiri75.com)) and went dark on December 26th 2025 as a _consumer facing product_ although we're still providing _business facing_ and _research_ services to companies and people who want to build on top of our research. 

## How was Mann-E different from the other generative platforms?

First, we were working on our own models which were based on __VQGAN__ (more specific __VQGAN+CLIP__ which provides the option of using _text to image_ functionality with VQGAN) and then we moved to better bases such as __Stable Diffusion__ by [Stability AI](https://stability.ai) and __Stable Diffusion 1.5__ by [Runway ML](https://runwayml.com) and started making finetunes, LoRA's and model merges and made our base models better and better. 

We also offered some sort of _knowledge distillation_ on top [Midjourney](https://midjourney.com) which was simply generating huge sets of data on top of midjourney, then use it to finetune our latest models. After a year of activity, we've just moved to __Stable Diffusion XL__ since it was a big model and after managing to have partnerships and support from companies such as [Runware](https://runware.ai), [Runpod](https://runpod.io) and [Modal](https://modal.com) and also getting edge computing services from [Fal AI](https://fal.ai) we moved all of our base models to FLUX. 

Since Fal, Runware, etc. let us use FLUX models commercially, we just tried to do the same exact formula on FLUX base and honestly, we've been successful to some extent. Later on, we also provided other generative models as well (as an API based service) but we emphasized that people use our own models to help us improve. 

## Why the platform faced a shut down?

It wasn't an easy decision to make. We've made decision of shutting it down just because the space is super competitive and if you're not manage to make a FOMO (Fear of missing out) like what Google does, you lose. We just decided to shut things up right before it goes too dark and uncontrollable.
